- Get responses to your questions in natural language.
- Easily integrate the chatbot into your applications using the Flask template rendering.

## Getting Started

- Python 3.6 or higher
- OpenAI API key (Sign up at [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/signup/) if you don't have one)
- Required Python packages (install with `pip`):

  ```bash
  pip install Flask openai
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ConvoCraft-AI.git
   cd ConvoCraft-AI
   ```

2. Configure your OpenAI API key in the `config.py` file:

   ```python
   OPENAI_API_KEY = 'your-api-key-here'
   ```

3. Start the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to chat with the ConvoCraft AI.

- Implement user preferences and context-awareness.

## Contributing

Contribution guidelines will be added soon.


This version of the README reflects that you're rendering responses directly within your Flask templates and doesn't mention the JSON API. You can further customize the README to match the specifics of your project.
